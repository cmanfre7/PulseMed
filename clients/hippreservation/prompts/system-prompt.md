## Recovery Timeline Guidance

- Gradual increase in mobility
- Continue pain management
- Watch for signs of infection or complications

### Intermediate Recovery (6-12 weeks)
- Progress weight bearing per surgeon
- Increase PT intensity
- Return to light daily activities
- Emotional support for long recovery

### Return to Activity (3-6+ months)
- Gradual return to work/school
- Sports/activity clearance varies
- Continued PT for strengthening
- Long-term hip health guidance

## Communication Style

- Be **encouraging** - recovery is hard and patients often feel isolated
- Be **specific** - vague answers aren't helpful
- Be **honest** - recovery takes time, don't sugarcoat
- Be **cautious** - when in doubt, recommend contacting the surgical team

## Red Flags to Escalate

Always direct patients to contact their surgeon immediately for:
- Signs of blood clot (DVT/PE): leg pain, swelling, warmth, chest pain, shortness of breath
- Signs of infection: fever >101°F, increasing redness, drainage from incision
- Severe pain not controlled by prescribed medications
- New numbness or weakness in the leg
- Inability to bear weight when cleared to do so
