## Common Questions

### Hip Dysplasia - Frequently Asked Questions

#### WHAT ARE THE EARLY SIGNS OF HIP DYSPLASIA IN ADULTS?

Early signs of hip dysplasia in adults include hip pain, especially during or after physical activity, a feeling of instability or the hip "giving way," and limited range of motion. Some people might also hear or feel a clicking or popping sensation in the hip joint.

#### HOW IS HIP DYSPLASIA DIAGNOSED, AND WHAT TESTS ARE INVOLVED?

Hip dysplasia is diagnosed through a combination of a physical exam, medical history review, and imaging tests like X-rays, MRI, or CT scans. The imaging helps to assess the shape of the hip joint and determine the severity of dysplasia.

#### CAN HIP DYSPLASIA LEAD TO ARTHRITIS, AND HOW CAN IT BE PREVENTED?

Yes, hip dysplasia can lead to osteoarthritis if left untreated, as the abnormal joint alignment causes wear and tear on the cartilage. Early diagnosis and treatment, including physical therapy, lifestyle modifications, or surgery, can help prevent arthritis.

#### ARE THERE NON-SURGICAL TREATMENTS FOR MANAGING HIP DYSPLASIA?

Non-surgical treatments for hip dysplasia include physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around the hip, lifestyle changes like weight management, and pain management strategies such as NSAIDs or corticosteroid injections. These can help alleviate symptoms but may not correct the underlying problem.

#### WHAT LIFESTYLE CHANGES CAN HELP MANAGE HIP DYSPLASIA SYMPTOMS?

Maintaining a healthy weight, engaging in low-impact exercises like swimming or cycling, avoiding activities that stress the hip joint, and practicing good posture can help manage hip dysplasia symptoms.

#### WHY ISN'T HIP ARTHROSCOPY ALONE ENOUGH FOR DYSPLASIA?

Because hip dysplasia is a structural instability problem. Arthroscopy treats soft tissue damage, such as labral tears, but does not correct inadequate hip socket coverage or joint instability.

#### CAN HIP ARTHROSCOPY MAKE DYSPLASIA WORSE?

In some cases, yes. If instability is not addressed, arthroscopy alone may increase stress on the labrum and cartilage, leading to persistent pain or recurrent injury.

#### WHO DECIDES IF I NEED PAO INSTEAD OF SCOPE ONLY?

This decision should be made by a hip preservation specialist with experience in both arthroscopic and open hip preservation surgery, based on imaging, physical exam, and hip stability.

#### WHAT HAPPENS IF I WAIT TO TREAT HIP DYSPLASIA?

In some cases, waiting is reasonable if symptoms are mild and the hip is stable. However, untreated dysplasia can lead to ongoing instability, cartilage damage, and an increased risk of arthritis over time.

#### CAN WAITING MAKE HIP PRESERVATION SURGERY LESS EFFECTIVE LATER?

Yes. Progressive cartilage damage may limit hip preservation options and reduce the long-term durability of surgery.

#### DOES PHYSICAL THERAPY PREVENT DYSPLASIA FROM GETTING WORSE?

Physical therapy can help manage symptoms and improve strength, but it does not correct the underlying structural instability of hip dysplasia.

#### HOW DO I KNOW IF I'VE WAITED TOO LONG?

Imaging findings, worsening pain, functional decline, and cartilage damage help determine whether hip preservation surgery is still appropriate.

### PAO Surgery - Frequently Asked Questions

#### WHAT CAN I EXPECT DURING THE RECOVERY PROCESS AFTER PAO SURGERY?

Recovery from PAO surgery involves a hospital stay of 3-5 days, followed by a period of limited weight-bearing on crutches for 6-8 weeks. Physical therapy is crucial during this time to restore strength and mobility. Full recovery may take 6-12 months.

#### HOW PAINFUL IS PAO SURGERY, AND HOW IS PAIN MANAGED POST-OPERATION?

PAO surgery is major surgery, so pain is expected post-operation. Pain is managed with a combination of pain medications, including NSAIDs and opioids initially, as well as ice therapy and physical therapy to reduce discomfort and improve mobility.

#### WHAT IS THE SUCCESS RATE OF PAO SURGERY, AND WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS?

PAO surgery has a high success rate, with many patients experiencing significant pain relief and improved hip function. However, potential complications include infection, blood clots, nerve or blood vessel injury, and the need for further surgery.

#### HOW LONG AFTER PAO SURGERY CAN I RETURN TO NORMAL ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING WORK AND EXERCISE?

Most patients can return to desk work within 6-8 weeks, but it may take 3-6 months to resume more strenuous activities and exercise. Full recovery, including high-impact sports, may take up to a year.

#### ARE THERE ANY SPECIFIC EXERCISES OR PHYSICAL THERAPY ROUTINES TO FOLLOW BEFORE AND AFTER PAO SURGERY?

Before surgery, strengthening exercises for the hip muscles, core, and legs are recommended. After surgery, a tailored physical therapy program will focus on gentle range-of-motion exercises, gradually progressing to strength and flexibility training as healing progresses.

#### CAN I GET PREGNANT AFTER PAO?

Yes. PAO does not affect fertility. Most patients can become pregnant once the hip has fully healed (typically 9–12 months after surgery).

#### WILL I NEED A C-SECTION?

Not necessarily. Most patients can have a vaginal delivery. A C-section is only needed for obstetric reasons or significant hip stiffness.

#### IS EPIDURAL ANESTHESIA SAFE AFTER PAO?

Yes. PAO does not limit the ability to receive an epidural or spinal anesthesia.

#### HOW DOES PREGNANCY AFFECT THE HIP?

You may have temporary soreness due to hormonal changes, but pregnancy does not compromise the PAO correction.

#### ARE LABOR POSITIONS LIMITED?

Most are safe. Your OB may help avoid positions requiring extreme hip flexion or wide abduction if they are uncomfortable.

#### IS PAO SURGERY VERY PAINFUL?

PAO is a major surgery, so pain is expected early on. However, pain is carefully managed and typically improves steadily during recovery.

#### HOW LONG DOES PAIN LAST AFTER PAO?

Most patients notice gradual improvement over the first several weeks, with continued progress as healing and strength return.

#### HOW IS PAIN CONTROLLED AFTER PAO?

Pain is managed using a multimodal approach that may include medications, physical therapy, and activity modification.

#### WHEN SHOULD I WORRY ABOUT PAIN AFTER PAO?

If pain worsens, becomes sharp or localized, or is associated with new symptoms, patients should contact their surgical team.

#### WILL I BE ASLEEP DURING HIP PRESERVATION SURGERY?

Yes. Most procedures are performed under general anesthesia, meaning you are fully asleep.

#### IS ANESTHESIA SAFE FOR PAO SURGERY?

Yes. Modern anesthesia is very safe and closely monitored throughout surgery.

#### WILL ANESTHESIA HELP WITH PAIN AFTER SURGERY?

Yes. Anesthesia techniques play an important role in early pain control and comfort.

#### CAN I DISCUSS ANESTHESIA CONCERNS BEFORE SURGERY?

Absolutely. You will meet with the anesthesia team before surgery to review your history and answer questions.

### Hip Scope Surgery - Frequently Asked Questions

#### WHAT CONDITIONS ARE TYPICALLY TREATED WITH HIP ARTHROSCOPY?

Hip arthroscopy is commonly used to treat conditions like labral tears, femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), cartilage damage, loose bodies, and some types of hip dysplasia.

#### HOW LONG DOES RECOVERY FROM HIP SCOPE SURGERY USUALLY TAKE?

Recovery from hip arthroscopy typically takes 3-6 months, with most patients returning to normal activities by 6 weeks and to sports or high-impact activities by 4-6 months.

#### WHAT ARE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH HIP ARTHROSCOPY?

Risks include infection, blood clots, nerve or blood vessel injury, stiffness, or continued pain. However, serious complications are rare, and most patients recover well.

#### CAN HIP ARTHROSCOPY PREVENT THE NEED FOR A TOTAL HIP REPLACEMENT?

Hip arthroscopy can delay or prevent the need for a total hip replacement by addressing joint issues early, improving hip function, and reducing pain. However, it may not be suitable for advanced arthritis or severe joint damage.

#### WHAT SHOULD I KNOW ABOUT POST-OPERATIVE CARE AND REHABILITATION AFTER HIP SCOPE SURGERY?

Post-operative care involves managing pain, controlling swelling, and protecting the hip joint during the initial healing phase. Physical therapy is crucial for restoring strength, flexibility, and range of motion. Adhering to the rehabilitation program is essential for a successful recovery.

### Post-Surgery Rehab - Frequently Asked Questions

#### WHAT ARE THE BEST EXERCISES TO AID RECOVERY AFTER HIP SURGERY?

Key exercises include gentle range-of-motion movements, leg lifts, bridges, and gradually progressing to more challenging strength and balance exercises like lunges and squats, under the guidance of a physical therapist.

#### HOW CAN I MANAGE PAIN AND SWELLING DURING THE REHAB PROCESS?

Pain and swelling can be managed with ice therapy, elevation, compression, and prescribed pain medications. Staying consistent with physical therapy exercises will also help reduce discomfort over time.

#### WHAT MILESTONES SHOULD I EXPECT IN MY RECOVERY TIMELINE?

Milestones include walking with minimal assistance within a few weeks, regaining full range of motion by 3 months, returning to light exercise by 3-4 months, and achieving full recovery and return to normal activities by 6-12 months.

#### ARE THERE ANY DIETARY CHANGES THAT CAN HELP SPEED UP RECOVERY AFTER HIP SURGERY?

A diet rich in protein, vitamins (especially C and D), and minerals like calcium and zinc can support tissue repair and bone health. Staying hydrated and avoiding excessive alcohol and smoking can also aid recovery.

#### HOW CAN I AVOID COMPLICATIONS LIKE INFECTIONS OR BLOOD CLOTS AFTER SURGERY?

Follow your surgeon's post-operative care instructions, take prescribed medications, perform leg exercises to maintain circulation, stay hydrated, and avoid prolonged sitting or lying down. Regular follow-up appointments are also important to monitor healing.

### Pre-Surgery Exercises - Frequently Asked Questions

#### WHAT EXERCISES SHOULD I DO TO STRENGTHEN MY HIP BEFORE SURGERY?

Focus on low-impact exercises that strengthen the hip muscles, such as straight leg raises, side-lying leg lifts, bridges, and seated hip abductions. Swimming and cycling are also good options.

#### HOW CAN I IMPROVE MY OVERALL FITNESS TO PREPARE FOR HIP SURGERY?

Engage in regular cardiovascular exercise like swimming or cycling, strength training, and flexibility exercises. Core strengthening exercises like planks and gentle yoga can also help improve overall fitness.

#### ARE THERE ANY EXERCISES TO AVOID BEFORE HIP SURGERY?

Avoid high-impact activities like running or jumping that may exacerbate hip pain or injury. Also, steer clear of exercises that cause significant discomfort or strain on the hip joint.

#### HOW CAN I MAINTAIN FLEXIBILITY AND RANGE OF MOTION BEFORE SURGERY?

Gentle stretching exercises, like seated hip stretches, hamstring stretches, and hip flexor stretches, can help maintain flexibility. Incorporating a regular yoga routine can also be beneficial.

#### WHAT ROLE DOES PHYSICAL THERAPY PLAY IN PRE-SURGERY PREPARATION?

Pre-surgery physical therapy, or "prehab," helps strengthen the muscles around the hip, improves flexibility, and prepares your body for surgery. It can also improve post-surgery outcomes by enhancing your physical condition beforehand.

### Avoiding Surgery - Frequently Asked Questions

#### WHAT NON-SURGICAL OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE FOR TREATING HIP PAIN?

Non-surgical options include physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications, corticosteroid injections, activity modification, and weight management. Alternative treatments like acupuncture or chiropractic care may also provide relief.

#### CAN LIFESTYLE CHANGES LIKE WEIGHT LOSS OR EXERCISE DELAY THE NEED FOR HIP SURGERY?

Yes, losing weight reduces stress on the hip joint, and regular exercise strengthens the muscles around the joint, potentially delaying or avoiding the need for surgery. Low-impact exercises like swimming and cycling are particularly beneficial.

#### HOW EFFECTIVE ARE INJECTIONS OR OTHER MINIMALLY INVASIVE TREATMENTS FOR HIP ISSUES?

Corticosteroid injections can provide temporary relief from inflammation and pain, and hyaluronic acid injections may help lubricate the joint. These treatments can be effective for managing symptoms, but they don't address the underlying cause.

#### WHAT ARE THE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES OF AVOIDING HIP SURGERY?

Avoiding necessary hip surgery can lead to worsening pain, decreased mobility, and joint damage, potentially resulting in arthritis or the need for more extensive surgery later on. Early intervention can often prevent further complications.

#### ARE THERE ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES THAT CAN HELP MANAGE HIP PAIN WITHOUT SURGERY?

Yes, alternative therapies like physical therapy, acupuncture, chiropractic adjustments, and targeted exercises can help manage hip pain. Additionally, dietary supplements like glucosamine and chondroitin may support joint health, though their efficacy varies.
