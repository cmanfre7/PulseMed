Hip pain in your mid-20s can feel confusing—and honestly, frustrating. At this age, most people expect their bodies to feel strong, capable, and resilient. So when something starts hurting, especially in a deep joint like the hip, it's natural to wonder:

"Is this normal? Did I injure something? Is this something serious?"

If you've been feeling persistent hip discomfort, stiffness, clicking, or pain with sports or daily activities, you're not alone. Many active young adults experience hip pain, and the causes are often very different from the arthritis-related issues seen in older adults. The good news? Most causes of hip pain at 25 are treatable—especially when caught early.

This guide will help you understand the most common conditions that cause hip pain in people under 30, what symptoms to look for, when to get help, and what recovery typically looks like.

## Why Am I Having Hip Pain at 25?

At 25, hip pain usually comes from structural issues, overuse, or a mismatch between your hip anatomy and the activities you're doing—not age-related wear and tear.

Here are the most common causes we see in young adults:

## 1. Labral Tears (One of the Most Common Causes)

If you feel a sharp pinch in the front of your hip, clicking, or a sense of instability, a labral tear may be the culprit.

### Common symptoms:

- Pain with sitting, squatting, running, or twisting
- Clicking, locking, or catching sensations
- Pain deep in the groin
- Feeling like the hip is "slipping" or unstable

The labrum is a ring of cartilage that helps stabilize your hip. In young adults, it's often torn because of subtle structural issues—like hip dysplasia or femoroacetabular impingement (FAI)—or from high-impact sports.

## 2. Femoroacetabular Impingement (FAI)

FAI is one of the most underdiagnosed causes of hip pain in people under 30. It happens when extra bone on the femur or hip socket causes the bones to pinch together.

### You may have FAI if:

- Your hip hurts during or after activity
- You struggle to rotate your hip outward or inward
- You feel pain after sitting for long periods
- You feel a deep ache in the front of your hip

FAI can also lead to labral tears if left untreated.

## 3. Hip Dysplasia (Yes—Adults Have This Too)

Most people think hip dysplasia only affects infants, but many cases go unnoticed until the teens or 20s.

In hip dysplasia, the socket is too shallow to support the femoral head, causing pain, instability, and labral injury.

### Signs of hip dysplasia:

- Pain with walking, running, or standing
- A deep, aching pain in the groin
- Feeling like your hip is loose or shifting
- A popping sensation with movement

This condition does not improve with stretching or time. Diagnosis and proper treatment can prevent early arthritis.

## 4. Bursitis and Tendonitis (Irritated Soft Tissues)

If your pain is on the outside of the hip, especially when lying on that side, it may be:

- Trochanteric bursitis
- Gluteus medius/minimus tendonitis

These issues are very common in runners, hikers, and people who recently increased training intensity.

### Symptoms:

- Pain on the outside of the hip
- Tenderness to touch
- Pain going up stairs
- Pain when lying on your side

## 5. Muscle Strains or Sports Overuse Injuries

Hip flexor or groin strains are especially common in:

- Soccer players
- Dancers
- Runners
- Weightlifters
- CrossFit athletes

If your hip pain started suddenly with exercise, a muscle strain could be the issue. These usually improve with rest and PT—but if pain continues beyond 4–6 weeks, deeper structural issues may be involved.

## 6. Hip Microinstability

Some young adults have hips that move excessively because of:

- Loose ligaments
- Labral injury
- Prior hip arthroscopy
- Subtle dysplasia

### Symptoms include:

- A feeling of your hip "slipping"
- Worsening pain with rotation
- Difficulty standing on one leg

## What Does Hip Pain at 25 Feel Like?

Patients commonly describe sensations such as:

- Sharp groin pinch when getting up from a chair
- Clicking or catching with movement
- Pain after long car rides
- Difficulty sitting cross-legged
- A deep ache after workouts or sports
- Pain radiating into the thigh or buttock

If any of this sounds familiar, you're not imagining it—and you're not too young for real hip problems.

## When Should a 25-Year-Old Get Their Hip Evaluated?

Seek evaluation if:

- Pain lasts more than 4–6 weeks
- You hear or feel clicking or locking
- Pain limits your workouts or daily activities
- You have pain at night or with sitting
- It feels like your hip "gives way"
- You've tried PT but aren't getting better

Early diagnosis is key. Many young adults spend years in unnecessary pain because their symptoms are dismissed or misdiagnosed.

## Do I Need Imaging?

A typical evaluation may include:

- **X-ray** – to look at bone structure and socket shape
- **MRI or MRI-Arthrogram** – to check for labral tears or cartilage damage
- **CT scan** (occasionally) – for advanced surgical planning

A hip preservation specialist understands how to interpret early structural abnormalities that general practitioners may miss.

## Treatment Options for Young Adults

Every hip is different, but treatment may include:

### 1. Physical Therapy

Focus on strengthening hip stabilizers, improving biomechanics, and reducing impingement.

### 2. Activity Modifications

Small changes—like adjusting squat depth or running form—may significantly reduce pain.

### 3. Injections

Diagnostic or therapeutic injections can help pinpoint the source of pain.

### 4. Hip Arthroscopy

Minimally invasive surgery to repair labral tears or reshape the bone in FAI patients.

### 5. PAO (Periacetabular Osteotomy)

A specialized reconstructive surgery used for hip dysplasia to realign the socket and protect the joint long term.

## You're Not Too Young for Real Hip Problems—and You Deserve Answers

Many patients tell us they've been told:

- "It's probably a pulled muscle."
- "You're too young for hip issues."
- "Just rest and take ibuprofen."

But if your pain has lasted months—or even years—it's not "just" soreness. Listening to your symptoms now can protect your hip for decades to come.

If you're 25 and dealing with ongoing hip pain, the next step is simple: Get evaluated by a hip preservation specialist who understands young adult hip conditions.
