If you've been struggling with unexplained hip pain, labral tears, or repeat diagnoses like "hip impingement" that never seem to resolve — you're not alone. Many young adults and athletes are living with undiagnosed hip dysplasia, a structural condition that can go unnoticed for years.

That's why we created our free downloadable eBook: "Understanding Hip Dysplasia: A Modern Guide for Young Adults and Athletes."

## What You'll Learn About Hip Dysplasia in Young Adults

This comprehensive guide was designed to help you take control of your health by answering questions like:

- What is hip dysplasia and why does it cause pain?
- How is it different from FAI or a labral tear?
- Why is it often missed in young and active patients?
- What imaging do you really need for a diagnosis?
- What are the best treatment options — and when is surgery appropriate?
- What is PAO surgery and what can I expect from recovery?

Whether you're newly diagnosed or just exploring possibilities, this guide breaks down complex information into clear, empowering insights.

## Who This Is For

- Young adults with chronic or recurring hip pain
- Female athletes, dancers, or yogis who've been told it's just a strain
- Patients told they "aren't candidates for surgery" without an in-depth evaluation
- Anyone considering PAO surgery or seeking a second opinion

## Why We Created This Resource

At HipPreservation.org, we see countless patients who've gone months — or even years — without a clear diagnosis. Many were told their pain was "in their head" or that they needed to wait until their hip was "bad enough" for replacement.

We believe you deserve better.

This eBook reflects our mission to provide trusted, joint-preserving care through patient education, precision diagnosis, and world-class surgical treatment — led by the Hip Preservation Team at Panorama Orthopedics & Spine Center.
