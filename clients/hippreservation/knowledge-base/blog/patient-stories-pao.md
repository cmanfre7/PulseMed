## Understanding Hip Dysplasia and the Power of PAO Surgery

Hip dysplasia occurs when the hip socket (acetabulum) does not fully cover the femoral head, leading to joint instability, pain, and early arthritis. This condition can be especially challenging for young athletes and active individuals. Fortunately, Periacetabular Osteotomy (PAO surgery) is a highly effective hip preservation procedure that realigns the hip socket to improve joint stability and function.

In this blog post, we share real patient success stories from individuals who have undergone PAO surgery and successfully reclaimed their mobility and active lifestyles.
