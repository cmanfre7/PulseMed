RETURN-TO-SPORT
TIMELINE
After
HIP ARTHROSCOPY
ATHLETE-FOCUSED
RECOVERY GUIDE

This timeline is a general roadmap for
athletes after hip arthroscopy. Your
exact pace depends on the
procedure performed, your sport, and
how your body responds. Always
follow your surgeon and physical
therapist’s instructions.

this
FIRST
Progress ≠ linear. Small setbacks are
normal—adjust, don’t quit.
Pain rule: keep activity ≤ 2/10 during
and after. If pain or swelling lasts >24
hours, step back.
Quality first. Form and control
matter more than volume or speed.
Track your response. Note pain,
stiffness, sleep, and swelling after
new steps.
What this guide is—and isn’t
Key principles
Clear communication = faster return.
Share soreness spikes, pinchy hip flexor pain, or lingering
swelling with your PT/surgeon quickly.

checkpoints
CLEARANCE
ROM: near-symmetrical
flexion/extension and rotation
without pinch.
Strength: hip & core ≥80% limb
symmetry to start impact; ≥90%
before sport practice (hand-held
dynamometer or PT testing).
Movement quality: pain-free
single-leg squat ×15 each side
with knee control; Y-Balance
within 95% symmetry.
Impact tolerance: walk 30–45
min pain-free; no next-day flare.
Cardio base: 20–30 min
continuous low-impact
(bike/elliptical/pool) at
conversational pace.
(move-forward gates)
Before you add impact or
advance phases, aim for:
Note: These are general criteria; your team may use different tests
(e.g., hop tests, isokinetic strength, HAGOS/iHOT scores).

(Protect & restore)
WEEKS 0–6 
Crutches per protocol (often 2–3 wks).
Ice/elevation, wound care, avoid hip-
flexor overuse.
Supine gentle ROM, ankle pumps,
diaphragmatic breathing.
Cardio: Upper-body ergometer; short
easy walks as allowed.
Wean crutches when gait is normal and cleared.
Stationary bike (no/low resistance), pool walking when incisions
healed.
Glute sets, bridges, clamshells, side-lying abduction (no pinch).
Core: dead bug variations, pallof press, farmer carry light.
Mobility: hip capsule-friendly stretching (avoid aggressive flexor work).
No running, cutting, or plyometrics.
Phase 1 – Protect & Restore
(Weeks 0–2)
Phase 2 – Early Rehab
(Weeks 2–6)
If hip flexor gets cranky, reduce straight-leg raises and substitute marches
with band, posterior chain emphasis.

Progressive resistance: bridges → hip thrusts; split squats; step-
ups; RDLs.
Lateral strength: banded walks, lateral step-downs.
Balance/proprioception: single-leg holds, reaches, perturbations.
Cardio: bike/elliptical with intervals; pool jog.
Intro low-amplitude plyometrics when cleared: pogo hops, line
hops.
Still no running unless cleared by checkpoints.
WEEKS 6–12

Pain ≤2/10 during/after

Pre-run checks:
Walk 45 min brisk, pain-free
Hip strength ≥80% symmetry
Dynamic control on single-leg squat & step-downs
MONTHS 3–4
(If pain/swelling >24h, repeat the last successful session.)
ADD-ONS
(alternate days): drills (A-skips, butt
kicks), light strides, mobility.
(Return to running)
Phase 4 – Impact Preparation &
Run Progression
4-Week Walk-to-Jog Progression (3x/week,
non-consecutive)

(Sport rebuild & return)
MONTHS 4–6+
Strength: heavy
lifts (as
programmed),
anti-rotation
core, lateral
power.
Change-of-
direction (45°
→ 90° → 180°),
low → high
intensity.
Non-contact
practice,
position drills,
and small-sided
games.
Running
progression →
tempo runs →
acceleration/de
celeration.
Phase 5 – Controlled Sport Re-Intro
(Months 4–6)
Plyos: box
jumps, bounds,
depth drops
(progress
carefully).

Phase 6 – Full Return to Sport (6–9+ months)
Clearance targets (typical):
Strength ≥90% symmetry (or
surgeon/PT target)
Hop or agility tests ≥90%
symmetry (if used)
Sport-specific conditioning:
complete a full practice at game
speed ×2 with ≤2/10 pain and no
next-day flare
Coach/PT/surgeon sign-off
Return ladder: individual skills → non-contact practice → controlled
scrimmage → limited minutes → full competition.
