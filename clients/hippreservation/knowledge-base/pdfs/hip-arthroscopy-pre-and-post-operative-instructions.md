Hip Arthroscopy Pre and Post-Operative Instructions 
Wound Care 
● You will have a waterproof dressing on your hip which should 
remain in place for 7 days post op (it will be removed on the same 
day your Ambit pump is discontinued). We will provide you 
additional waterproof dressings (tegaderm) to place on the incisions 
after 7 days. 
● It is normal to see a lot of blood-tinged soaked fluid on the 
bandages. This may appear to be a pinkish-yellow fluid and is 
normal. 
● We recommend that you wait 7 days to shower so that your Ambit 
pain pump does not get dislodged or wet. However if you must 
shower before post op day 7 please keep the pain pump dry outside 
of the shower. Your dressing will be waterproof but please do not 
soak in water (take a bath, swim in a hot tub or pool) for at least 4 
weeks after surgery. 
● If you have a compressive wrap you may remove it to shower, then 
put it back on afterwards for compression. 
● Should the incisions accidentally get wet, pat them dry with a clean 
towel and replace with a new bandage. Do not scrub. 
● Do not apply lotions or ointments to the incision sites for at least 4 
weeks. 
● Do not allow pets to sit in your lap or sleep in your bed for 4 weeks 
post surgery. 
Physical Therapy 
● Begin physical therapy 2-3 days post-surgery. 
○ You are responsible for scheduling PT sessions. Ensure appointments are set 
up before surgery. 
○ A PT referral will be provided during your surgery consultation. 
○ Post-op PT protocols can be found on our website: www.HipPreservation.org 
-> Patient Resources -> Therapy and Rehab. 
Weight Bearing 
● You’ll be partial weight-bearing (PWB) on the operated leg with crutches for support. 
○ Walk with a flat foot and mimic a normal gait. 
○ Crutches will be required for 3 weeks after labral repair and 6 weeks after 
labral reconstruction, augmentation, or microfracture. 

 
Hip Brace 
● The brace fitting will be arranged before surgery. 
○ The brace is worn only while walking for 6 weeks post-surgery. 
○ You do not need to wear the brace while sleeping, icing, showering, going to the 
bathroom, using the CPM machine, or using the upright bike.. 
○ The brace prevents excessive hip movement and ensures stability during 
recovery. 
Continuous Passive Motion (CPM) Machine 
● The CPM company will reach out to you to deliver the CPM machine. Most likely will be 
delivered to you a few days before surgery. 
○ Start using it the day of surgery or the next day for 4-6 hours/day for 6 weeks. 
○ Begin at a rate of 1 cyle/minute, randing from 20° of extension and 55° flexion, 
increase by 7-8° daily as tolerated (max 0-90°). 
Ice Therapy 
● For the first 72 hours, ice the hip 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off. 
● After 72 hours, ice 4-5 times per day then as needed after two weeks. 
○ Always place the ice over a thin layer of material, never directly on the skin. 
Medications 
● You will be prescribed a combination of tylenol, antiinflammatories, muscle relaxers and 
opioid pain medication to minimize your post-operative pain. 
● These will be prescribed and refilled on an as needed basis. 
● Do not drink alcohol, drive, or operate heavy machinery while taking opioid medications. 
Pain Pump 
 
To relieve pain after surgery, you will have a small disposable pump filled with a local anesthetic 
medication. It continuously delivers the medication, which blocks the pain in the area of your 
procedure. The pain pump works with other medications or therapies your doctor may prescribe 
to manage your pain. With it, you may need less narcotics and have better pain relief than with 
narcotics alone
. 
 
● Near the surgical incision, you will have a catheter that is attached to a pain 
pump 
● This pump delivers non-narcotic medication automatically to the surgical site 
● After 7 days you can remove the catheter along with your dressings 

 
● The pump is NOT disposable and must be returned 
● Instructions for removal of catheter and returning the pump can be found at the 
end of the packet- Just making sure there will be additional information for 
pump removal at the end of the packet- there is not currently 
 
General Activity 
● Change positions frequently, alternating between sitting, reclining, and lying down to 
avoid stiffness. 
● Wear compression socks (TED hose) for the first 2 weeks post-surgery. 
● Spend 1-2 hours/day on your stomach without the brace. 
● You may begin driving about 1 week post-surgery, as long as you're not taking narcotic 
pain medications. 
Follow-Up 
● Your first post-op appointment will be with one of our physician assistants 10-14 days 
post-surgery. Follow-up visits will be scheduled at 6 weeks and 3 months. 
When to Contact Us 
● If you develop a fever over 100.4°F or experience chills/sweats. 
● If you notice pus, redness, or severe pain around the incision sites. 
● If you’re unable to urinate within 1-2 days post-surgery. 
Possible Complications 
● Infection: Minimize the risk by keeping the incision clean and following wound care 
instructions. 
● DVT (blood clots): Early movement, compression stockings, and medications help 
reduce this risk. 
● Pain: Expected after surgery but managed with medication, ice, and physical therapy. 
● Numbness: Temporary numbness in the thigh is possible due to nerve stretching. 
● Heterotopic Ossification: Unwanted bone growth is prevented by taking Indomethacin 
as prescribed.
