## When Wear and Tear Mimics Other Hip Conditions

Hip arthritis is a progressive condition that causes joint pain, stiffness, and limited mobility due to cartilage breakdown. While it's more common in older adults, younger individuals may worry they have arthritis when their pain is actually caused by something else—like a labral tear or impingement. Learn the difference, understand the symptoms, and explore modern treatment options to protect your hip joint and stay active.

## What is Arthritis?

Arthritis is a general term that refers to inflammation of a joint. In the hip, this can lead to symptoms like pain, stiffness, swelling, and reduced range of motion. While arthritis is more common in older adults, many younger or active individuals start to worry about arthritis when they experience persistent hip pain.

But here's the key: most hip pain in young, active patients is not caused by arthritis. Conditions like labral tears, femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), or hip dysplasia are often the real culprits—and they can mimic arthritis symptoms in the early stages.

That said, understanding arthritis is still important, especially for patients dealing with:

- A family history of early arthritis
- Past trauma or surgeries to the hip
- Underlying joint instability or cartilage injury

### Types of Hip Arthritis You May Hear About:

- **Osteoarthritis (OA):** The most common form, caused by cartilage degeneration over time. This can lead to bone-on-bone contact, stiffness, and pain with activity or rest.

- **Inflammatory Arthritis (e.g., Rheumatoid, Lupus, Psoriatic):** These autoimmune conditions cause the body to attack its own joints, often leading to widespread pain, morning stiffness, and joint swelling.

- **Post-Traumatic Arthritis:** Develops after a major hip injury (fracture or dislocation) that alters joint structure and accelerates cartilage wear.

- **Other Types:** Less common forms include gout, pseudo-gout, or septic arthritis, caused by crystal buildup or infection inside the joint.

If you're under 40 and have hip pain, it's far more likely due to a labral tear or impingement than to arthritis—but a proper evaluation can rule it out.

## How is Arthritis Diagnosed?

Diagnosing arthritis starts with a combination of clinical evaluation, patient history, and imaging studies. But for younger or athletic individuals, it's just as important to rule out other causes of hip pain that can feel similar—like labral tears, FAI, or instability due to dysplasia.

A thorough evaluation helps determine:

- Whether arthritis is truly the cause of your pain
- How advanced the condition is
- What treatment options will give you the best outcome

### What's Involved in the Diagnosis:

- **Symptom Review:** You'll be asked about pain location, stiffness (especially in the morning), swelling, joint clicking or catching, and whether symptoms worsen with activity or rest.

- **Physical Examination:** Your provider will assess range of motion, joint stability, strength, and movement patterns that may reveal arthritis or other structural conditions.

- **X-rays:** These can reveal joint space narrowing, bone spurs (osteophytes), subchondral cysts, or signs of bone-on-bone contact—hallmarks of osteoarthritis.

- **MRI or Other Imaging (if needed):** While not always required, MRI can detect early cartilage changes or rule out labral tears, inflammation, or other soft tissue issues.

### Important Note for Younger Patients:

It's common to see imaging that suggests early arthritis even in people with minimal symptoms—or vice versa. In our practice, we don't treat X-rays alone—we treat people. If your imaging shows arthritis but your symptoms are mild, we'll focus on functional goals and non-surgical options first.

Accurate diagnosis is key—not just to confirm arthritis, but to ensure it's the right diagnosis in the first place.

If your pain feels sharp, comes with clicking or catching, or flares up during movement—it's more likely a labral tear than arthritis.

## Treatment Options for Hip Arthritis

The goal of hip arthritis treatment is to reduce pain, improve mobility, and maintain an active lifestyle for as long as possible. For many people—especially those with early or mild arthritis—this can be achieved through non-surgical approaches.

At HipPreservation.org, we take a stepwise, personalized approach based on the severity of your symptoms, the level of joint damage, and your functional goals. Even in cases where imaging shows "bone-on-bone" arthritis, we prioritize treatments that support long-term joint health and patient activity.

### Non-Surgical Treatments for Hip Arthritis

Most patients start with a combination of the following conservative options:

- Anti-inflammatory medications (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen, acetaminophen) to reduce pain and joint inflammation
- Physical therapy to strengthen surrounding muscles, protect the joint, and improve mobility
- Activity modification to reduce repetitive impact and improve movement patterns
- Mobility aids, such as a cane or walker, to reduce stress on the joint during flare-ups
- Weight management, if needed, to reduce pressure on the hip joint
- Joint injections including:
  - Corticosteroids (for short-term pain relief)
  - Hyaluronic acid (to improve joint lubrication)
  - Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for regenerative support

✅ Many patients experience significant relief with these approaches—especially when treatment is started early and combined with structured rehab.

### Surgical Options (When Conservative Care Isn't Enough)

If symptoms progress despite conservative care, or if arthritis becomes advanced, surgery may be considered. Surgical options include:

- **Hip arthroscopy:** For select cases of early arthritis with labral damage or bone impingement, minimally invasive hip arthroscopy can reduce symptoms and delay joint deterioration.

- **Total Hip replacement (THA):** For end-stage arthritis, especially in older or low-demand patients, total hip arthroplasty (THA) may be the most effective long-term solution.

⚠️ At HipPreservation.org, hip replacement is not our first choice—especially for younger, active patients. We aim to preserve the natural joint whenever possible and delay or avoid joint replacement through thoughtful care.

### The Bottom Line:

Whether your hip pain is due to early arthritis or another condition entirely, our focus is on finding the least invasive option that helps you stay active and pain-free.

You don't have to give up your lifestyle because of arthritis—especially if it's not truly the root cause of your hip pain.

## Still Wondering If It's Arthritis? Let's Find Out Together

If you've been told you have hip arthritis—or suspect it might be the cause of your pain—we're here to help you find clarity.

At HipPreservation.org, we specialize in evaluating hip pain in young, active individuals. While arthritis is one possible cause, it's often mistaken for structural conditions like labral tears, FAI, or hip dysplasia—which require a different treatment approach.

Let's make sure you're getting the right diagnosis and the right plan to keep you moving.

The right treatment starts with the right diagnosis—and we'll help you get there.
