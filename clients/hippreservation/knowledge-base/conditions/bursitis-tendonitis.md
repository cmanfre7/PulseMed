## Inflamed Tissues, Irritated Movement

Hip bursitis and tendonitis are common causes of outer hip pain—especially in active individuals. These conditions occur when soft tissues around the hip become inflamed due to overuse, misalignment, or prior injury. Learn how to identify symptoms, reduce inflammation, and restore pain-free movement through targeted, non-surgical care.

## What Are Bursitis and Tendonitis?

Hip bursitis and hip tendonitis are soft tissue conditions that cause pain, tenderness, and inflammation around the hip joint. Though different in origin, they often present with similar symptoms—and can even occur at the same time.

- **Bursitis** involves inflammation of a bursa—a small, fluid-filled sac that cushions and protects areas where tendons and muscles glide over bones.
- **Tendonitis** (or tendinopathy) is the irritation or inflammation of a tendon, the thick cord that connects muscle to bone.

In the hip, these issues commonly affect:

- The greater trochanter (outer hip bone), where tendons and bursae support movement
- The iliopsoas tendon (front of the hip), especially in athletes or runners

When these tissues become irritated, movement can feel painful or restricted—particularly during walking, running, or lying on the affected side.

### Bursitis and Tendonitis Are Often Misdiagnosed

Because their symptoms overlap with conditions like hip impingement, labral tears, or early arthritis, a careful evaluation is needed to rule out deeper joint issues.

The key difference? These are inflammatory soft-tissue conditions—not structural damage to the joint itself.

## What Causes Hip Bursitis and Tendonitis?

These conditions often develop from repetitive stress, biomechanical imbalances, or underlying structural issues in the hip. They can affect athletes, weekend warriors, and even those with sedentary lifestyles—especially if movement patterns are off or prior injuries exist.

### Common Contributing Factors:

- **Overuse from repetitive motion:** Activities like running, cycling, stair climbing, or heavy lifting can overload the tendons and bursae, triggering inflammation.

- **Muscle imbalances or weakness:** Poor gluteal or core strength shifts strain to the outer hip and deep flexors.

- **Poor posture or altered gait mechanics:** Limping, pelvic tilt, or leg length discrepancies increase tension in hip-supporting tendons.

- **Prior injury or surgery:** Hip trauma, falls, or post-op changes can cause friction points that lead to irritation.

- **Underlying conditions:** Structural issues such as femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), hip dysplasia, or labral tears can create abnormal movement patterns that overload soft tissue.

Bursitis and tendonitis are often not the root cause—but a symptom of deeper imbalance. That's why accurate diagnosis matters.

## Common Symptoms of Bursitis and Tendonitis

Recognizing the symptoms of hip bursitis and tendonitis early can help prevent long-term discomfort or more serious joint problems.

### Typical Symptoms Include:

- Aching or burning pain on the outer hip, upper thigh, or groin
- Pain with activity, especially walking, climbing stairs, or rising from a chair
- Tenderness to touch near the greater trochanter (outer hip bone)
- Discomfort when lying on the affected side
- Stiffness or reduced range of motion
- Occasional swelling or warmth around the irritated area
- Pain at night, particularly when pressure is placed on the hip

Pain from bursitis and tendonitis is often localized and positional, unlike joint pain from conditions like arthritis or labral tears.

### Signs You Might Have Bursitis or Tendonitis

- ✔ Outer hip pain
- ✔ Pain when lying on your side
- ✔ Tender to the touch
- ✔ Gets worse with activity
- ✔ Improves with rest

## Diagnosing Hip Bursitis and Tendonitis

Because bursitis and tendonitis often mimic other hip conditions—like labral tears, FAI, or even early arthritis—accurate diagnosis is key to getting the right treatment plan.

### What to Expect During Evaluation:

- **Medical History & Activity Review:** Understanding your daily habits, sports participation, and any past injuries helps identify root causes.

- **Physical Exam:** A specialist will check for tenderness, swelling, weakness, and movement limitations. Pain reproduction during certain movements helps pinpoint the affected structure.

- **Imaging Studies:**
  - **X-rays:** To rule out bone spurs, joint degeneration, or structural deformities
  - **MRI:** To visualize soft tissue inflammation, tendon thickening, or bursitis
  - **Ultrasound:** Real-time imaging to assess bursa or tendon movement during motion

While imaging can confirm bursitis or tendonitis, clinical experience is essential to distinguish it from deeper joint issues like impingement or dysplasia.

## Non-Surgical Treatment Options

Most cases of hip bursitis and tendonitis respond well to conservative care, especially when treatment starts early.

### Common Treatment Strategies:

- **Physical Therapy:** Targeted exercises improve flexibility, correct muscle imbalances, and promote tendon healing. Strengthening the glutes, core, and pelvis often reduces strain on irritated tissues.

- **Activity Modification:** Avoiding pain-triggering movements like hill running or prolonged standing gives inflamed tissue time to recover. Posture and gait retraining may also be recommended.

- **Injections:**
  - Corticosteroids reduce inflammation quickly during flare-ups
  - Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections support longer-term healing by stimulating tissue repair

- **Anti-inflammatory Medications:** NSAIDs like ibuprofen or naproxen may be used short term to control pain and swelling.

- **Ice and Rest:** Especially helpful after activity, icing the affected area helps calm soft tissue irritation.

With consistent rehab and expert guidance, most patients experience improvement within 4 to 6 weeks—often without needing surgery.

## When Is Surgery Needed?

Surgery for hip bursitis or tendonitis is rarely the first step. In most cases, inflammation resolves with proper rehab and activity adjustments. However, if symptoms persist beyond several months—or if an underlying structural issue is contributing to soft tissue overload—surgical intervention may be considered.

### Surgery May Be Recommended If:

- Pain persists despite 3–6 months of targeted non-surgical care
- Imaging shows tendon tearing, degeneration, or calcification
- You have recurring flare-ups that impact daily life or performance
- Bursitis or tendonitis is linked to another problem like FAI, labral tears, or hip dysplasia

### Common Surgical Procedures:

- **Endoscopic Bursectomy:** Minimally invasive removal of the inflamed bursa to reduce friction and swelling.

- **Tendon Debridement or Repair:** Removal of damaged tendon tissue or repair of partial tears to restore healthy movement.

- **Hip Arthroscopy:** A camera-assisted procedure used to address hidden causes like bone impingement, labral damage, or structural misalignment that may be irritating soft tissues.

Surgery is most effective when it addresses not just the inflamed tissue, but the biomechanical cause behind it.

## Recovery and Rehabilitation

Most patients with hip bursitis or tendonitis improve significantly with a consistent, guided recovery plan.

### Recovery Without Surgery

With a non-surgical plan, most patients begin to notice improvement in 4 to 6 weeks, especially when inflammation is addressed early and biomechanical issues are corrected.

Key components of conservative rehab:

- Progressive physical therapy targeting glute, core, and hip stabilizers
- Gradual return to activities like walking, biking, or running
- Ongoing posture and movement training to reduce strain
- Occasional maintenance treatments (e.g., PRP, dry needling, soft tissue release)

### Post-Surgical Recovery

If surgery is performed—such as bursectomy, tendon debridement, or arthroscopy—full recovery can take 8 to 12 weeks, depending on the procedure and your starting condition.

Typical surgical rehab milestones:

- Weeks 1–2: Pain and swelling management, gentle movement, and protected weight-bearing
- Weeks 3–6: Mobility and strength-building, soft tissue reconditioning
- Weeks 7–12: Return to normal activity, sport-specific training, and long-term injury prevention

## Long-Term Outlook

With proper diagnosis, early treatment, and a personalized rehab plan, most people recover fully from hip bursitis and tendonitis—without surgery or long-term limitations.

### What You Can Expect Long-Term:

- Pain-free movement with strength and stability restored
- Improved function in everyday activities and sports
- Lower risk of recurrence with corrected biomechanics
- More confidence returning to the activities you love

The key to lasting results isn't just treating the symptoms—it's understanding why they started and how to keep them from coming back.
