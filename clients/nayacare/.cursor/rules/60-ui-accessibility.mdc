# Chat Widget
- Mobile‑first; loads <2s on 4G; keyboard + screen‑reader accessible.
- Consent banner prior to first message; persistent footer with scope disclaimer.
- Provide quick‑links to “What’s normal vs. red flags,” self‑care checklist, and PDF download.


# Admin Console
- Role‑based views; show version diff for KB; push “safety notice” banner quickly site‑wide.
