# Platform Defaults
- CMS theme: server‑rendered HubSpot CMS with custom modules (React where appropriate).
- Backend: **HubSpot Serverless Functions** (Node 18+). Use TypeScript in repo; compile during upload.
- Data: **HubDB** + **Custom Objects** for KB and telemetry; **Files** for PDFs; **Sensitive Data** properties for PHI.
- Auth: HubSpot CRM + Private App (scoped OAuth) for admin tools; role‑based access via Teams & Permissions.
- AI Vendors: Prefer vendors with BAAs. If none, de‑identify before sending.


# External Options (feature‑flagged)
- Optional external vector DB (e.g., pgvector) behind a proxy function. Default MVP uses tag/keyword search + embeddings cached in HubDB (no server‑side vector ops required).
- Email/SMS via HubSpot Marketing tools; staff alerts via Slack app (if approved).


# Required Middlewares
- Readability (≤ Grade 8) on outbound messages.
- Consent gate and Sensitive Data flags before storing/chatting about PHI.---
