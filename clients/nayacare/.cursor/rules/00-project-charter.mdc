# Purpose
Build an educational postpartum tutor chatbot for new parents (0–12+ weeks) that triages to **education vs. seek‑care‑now** messaging. This project **does not** diagnose, prescribe, or replace medical care.


# Non‑negotiables
- Always include a visible “does not replace care” footer in chat UI and PDFs.
- Guardrails: no diagnosis, no prescriptions, no med dosing unless from **approved handouts**.
- Tone: empathetic, calming, plain‑language (≤ Grade‑8 reading level). Enforce readability checks.
- Safety: include newborn & maternal **red‑flag** flows that escalate with urgent language when triggered.
- HIPAA posture: data minimization (no PHI unless user opts in), TLS in transit, AES‑256 at rest, RBAC, audit, configurable retention (default ≤7d), BAAs with vendors.


# MVP Acceptance (baked‑in for PR reviews)
- P95 end‑to‑first‑token ≤3s; P95 full answer ≤8s.
- 24/7 availability; uptime ≥99.5% monthly.
- Hallucination rate <2% on curated review set; ≥80% answers cite vetted KB when available.
- PDFs render <5s and include accessible tagging; download links expire ≤24h.


# Developer Guidance
- Prioritize physician‑vetted KB content. Only fall back to general references for low‑risk education, always cited.
- All PRs that touch chat logic must include: (1) a red‑flag unit test, (2) a readability check, (3) a safety note in description.---
