# HubSpot Settings
- Enterprise account with **Sensitive Data** enabled; accept HubSpot **BAA**. Restrict PHI to designated properties only.
- Enable audit logging, IP allowlist for admin, SSO, and field‑level permissions on Sensitive Data.


# Data Handling
- Default: no PHI retention. If consented, store minimally in Sensitive Data properties; encrypt at rest (HubSpot managed).
- Log consent timestamp & policy version on the contact.


# Third‑Party Calls
- If AI vendor is not covered by BAA, run **de‑identification** in functions and exclude PHI from prompts.


# PDFs & Links
- PDFs generated via serverless function; stored in Files with short‑lived signed URLs (≤24h) shared to the user.
