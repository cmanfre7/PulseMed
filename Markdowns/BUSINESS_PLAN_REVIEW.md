## 🔴 **CRITICAL GAPS - Must Add Before Investor/Partner Meetings**

### 1. **Team & Founders Section** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Status:** COMPLETELY MISSING

**What's Needed:**
- Founder backgrounds (Dr. Patel's credentials, your technical expertise)
- Advisory board (if any)
- Key hires needed (sales, customer success, engineering)
- Why THIS team can execute THIS vision

**Why It Matters:** Investors bet on teams, not just ideas. This is often the first thing they look for.

**Recommendation:** Add section after Executive Summary:
```markdown
## Team & Founders

### Founders
- **Dr. Sonal Patel** - [Credentials, medical background, why she understands the problem]
- **[Your Name]** - [Technical background, previous experience, why you can build this]

### Advisory Board (if applicable)
- [Names and credentials]

### Key Hires Needed (Year 1)
- VP of Sales (Month 3-4)
- Customer Success Manager (Month 6)
- Senior Engineer (Month 8)
```

---

### 2. **Market Size & TAM/SAM/SOM** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Status:** MENTIONED BUT NOT QUANTIFIED

**What's Needed:**
- Total Addressable Market (TAM): How many medical practices exist?
- Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM): How many could realistically use this?
- Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM): How many can you capture in 3-5 years?

**Example Framework:**
- TAM: 1.1M medical practices in US × $5,000/month = $66B/year
- SAM: 200K practices that could benefit × $5,000/month = $12B/year
- SOM (Year 3): 200 practices × $5,000/month = $12M/year

**Why It Matters:** Shows you understand the opportunity size and are realistic about capture.

---

### 3. **Customer Acquisition Strategy** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Status:** VAGUE - "Sales process development" isn't enough

**What's Needed:**
- **Go-to-Market Channels:**
  - Direct sales (how many reps, what territories?)
  - Medical conferences (which ones, how many leads?)
  - Physician referrals (incentive structure?)
  - Partnerships (EHR vendors, medical associations?)
  - Content marketing (webinars, case studies, white papers?)

- **Sales Process:**
  - Average sales cycle length (30/60/90 days?)
  - Conversion rates (demo → pilot → paid)
  - Cost per acquisition (CAC)
  - Sales team structure (inside vs. field sales)

- **Customer Personas:**
  - Early adopters (who buys first?)
  - Decision makers (physician vs. practice manager vs. IT?)
  - Buying process (who approves, what's the budget cycle?)

**Recommendation:** Add detailed section:
```markdown
## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Primary Channels (Year 1)
1. **Direct Sales** - 2 inside sales reps targeting [specific specialties/regions]
2. **Medical Conferences** - [List 3-5 key conferences, booth strategy]
3. **Physician Referrals** - [Incentive program details]
4. **Partnerships** - EHR vendors, medical associations

### Sales Process
- Average sales cycle: 60-90 days
- Conversion funnel: 100 leads → 30 demos → 10 pilots → 5 paid customers
- CAC: $5,000-8,000 per customer
- Sales team: 2 inside sales reps (Month 3), 1 field rep (Month 6)

### Customer Personas
- **Primary Buyer**: Practice Manager or IT Director
- **Champion**: Lead Physician
- **Budget**: $5,000-12,000/month (recurring)
- **Decision Factors**: ROI proof, HIPAA compliance, ease of use
```

### 4. **Customer Success & Retention** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Status:** MENTIONED BUT NOT DETAILED

**What's Needed:**
- Onboarding process (how long, what steps?)
- Customer success metrics (NPS, retention rate, expansion revenue)
- Churn mitigation strategy
- Expansion revenue (upsell from Starter → Professional → Enterprise)
- Support structure (tiered support, SLAs, response times)

**Why It Matters:** SaaS businesses live or die on retention. Need to show you've thought this through.

**Recommendation:** Add section:
```markdown
## Customer Success & Retention

### Onboarding Process
- Week 1: Knowledge base setup, document upload
- Week 2: Triage configuration (if needed), branding customization
- Week 3: Training sessions, go-live support

## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Immediate (This Week):**
   - Add Team & Founders section
   - Quantify market size (TAM/SAM/SOM)
   - Detail customer acquisition strategy
   - Create 3-year financial projections

2. **Short-Term (Next 2 Weeks):**
   - Add customer success & retention section
